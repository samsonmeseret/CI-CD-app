To allow your Jenkins container to access the Docker daemon on the host machine, you need to grant it the necessary permissions. Typically, this involves adding the Jenkins user to the Docker group on the host machine.

```
sudo usermod -aG docker <jenkins_user>

```

Add the Jenkins user to the Docker group: Once you know the Jenkins container user, you'll add it to the Docker group on the host machine. This allows the Jenkins user to interact with the Docker daemon. Run the following command on the host machine:

```
sudo usermod -aG docker <jenkins_user>

```

Replace <jenkins_user> with the user running the Jenkins container. For example, if the Jenkins container is running as the jenkins user, you would run:

```
sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins

```

Restart Docker: After adding the Jenkins user to the Docker group, restart the Docker service on the host machine to apply the changes:

```

sudo systemctl restart docker
```

1. Host User vs. Container User: When we talk about adding a user to the Docker group, we're referring to a user on the host system (the system where Docker is installed), not a user within the Docker container.

2. Jenkins Container: The Jenkins container runs with its own internal user accounts, typically defined by the Jenkins image. These users are isolated within the container and are separate from users on the host system.

3. Access to Docker Daemon: By adding a user on the host system (e.g., the user obtained from whoami) to the Docker group, we grant that user permissions to interact with the Docker daemon running on the host. This allows them to run Docker commands and manage Docker containers.

4. Why Add Jenkins User to Docker Group: In some cases, you may want the Jenkins container to perform Docker-related tasks, such as building and deploying other containers. By adding the host user who is running Jenkins to the Docker group, you grant the Jenkins container the necessary permissions to execute Docker commands on the host.

5. Security Considerations: Granting Docker access to a user, whether it's the user running Jenkins or any other user on the host system, comes with security implications. You should ensure that only trusted users have access to Docker, as they effectively gain control over the Docker daemon and can manipulate containers and images on the host system.

6. Communication between Host and Container: Communication between the host system and containers is typically achieved through Docker's networking and volume mechanisms. Users on the host system interact with Docker using Docker CLI commands, while processes inside the container interact with the Docker daemon via the Docker API.

In summary, adding the host user (e.g., obtained from whoami) to the Docker group grants permissions to that user on the host system, allowing processes running within Docker containers, such as Jenkins, to interact with the Docker daemon running on the host. This facilitates tasks like building and deploying Docker containers from within Jenkins pipelines.
